This program is built to help automate the task of locating breached credentials on the internet. 
This script currently is built to use Hunter.io and Dehashed APIs to collect infoamtion on a pecified domain or target name. 
In the future, we intend to find and use more APIs to help find and locate more breached credentials. 

This is a work in progress.
