Give Me A Target

This program allows the user to give a company name and find their domain with Hunter.io then pipe it into dehashed to finded breached credentials. It does this through the use of APIs. In the future, I plan to add more osint capabilities to help automate the osint required for external penetration tests.

This is a work in progress.
