# Give Me A Target, aka GMAT
Created by Ryan 'Ghost' Voit and Mark 'Dread' Perekopsky

This program is built to help automate some tasks when conducting OSINT on a client. 
This script currently is built to find breached credentials from either an organization name or domain name using Hunter.io and dehashed APIs to collect infoamtion. 
In the future, this script will grow larger to help automate more tasks related to OSINT. 

This is a work in progress.
