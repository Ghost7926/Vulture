Give Me A Target is created by Ryan 'Ghost' Voit and Mark 'Dread' Perekopsky

This program allows the user to give a company name and find their domain with Hunter.io then pipe it into dehashed to finded breached credentials. It does this through the use of APIs privided by Hunter.io and Dehashed. In the future, I plan to add more osint capabilities to help automate the osint required for external penetration tests.

This is a work in progress.
